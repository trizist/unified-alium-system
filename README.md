Unified ALIUM System Repository

Overview

The Unified ALIUM System (UAS) is a multi-dimensional framework bridging spiritual futurism and engineering excellence. Led by Umair Siddiquie, it integrates adaptive resilience, machine learning, and metacognition to achieve amplified intelligence through unified, ethical system design.

This repository provides the source code, reference architectures, standards documentation, and deployment resources for the ALIUM system.
